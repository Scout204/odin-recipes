    <h4><em>Ingredients</em></h4>
</body>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup milk (or buttermilk for extra fluffiness)</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)</li>
</ul>
<body>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
</body>
<ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients and gently mix until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
    <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
    <li>Preheat a griddle or a non-stick skillet over medium heat. If needed, lightly grease the surface with butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the griddle for each pancake. If desired, add a few extra chocolate chips on top of each pancake.</li>
    <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges start to look set, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Carefully flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the pancakes are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
    <li>Remove the pancakes from the griddle and repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Serve the chocolate chip pancakes warm, topped with butter, additional chocolate chips, and maple syrup.</li>
